# Machine-Learning-Course
All code from this repository is for the programming assignments from the online course "Machine Learning" given by Stanford University on Coursera, and taught by Professor Andrew Yang. The grade achieved was 100% for the entire course, which spanned 11 weeks.
# Getting Started
The code is run on the scientific programming language [GNU Octave 3.8.0](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), with its interpreter invoked as part of a shell script. It should also be easy to adapt the code for running in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
# Overview
As was said earlier, the course was divided into 11 weeks, almost all of which contained 1 or 2 programming assignments. The topics covered in each week follow:
## Week 1: 
- Linear Regression with one variable/Gradient Descent
- Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
- Feature Normalization
## Week 2:
- Logistic Regression
- Regularized Logistic Regression
- Feature Mapping
## Week 3:
- One vs. All Logistic Regression/Multi-Class Classification
- Shallow Neural Networks (Feedforward Propagation)
## Week 4:
- Shallow Neural Networks (Backpropagation)
## Week 5:
- Regularized Polynomial Regression
- Handling Bias/Variance 
## Week 6:
- Support Vector Machines
- Gaussian Kernels
## Week 7:
- Image Compression with K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Principal Component Analysis
## Week 8:
- Anomaly Detection Algorithm
- Collaborative Filtering Algorithm/Recommender Systems
