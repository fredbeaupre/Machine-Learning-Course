# Machine-Learning-Course
All code from this repository is for the programming assignments from the online course "Machine Learning" given by Stanford University on Coursera, and taught by Professor Andrew Yang. The grade achieved was 100% for the entire course, which spanned 11 weeks.
# Getting Started
The code was run on [GNU Octave 3.8.0](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), with its interpreter invoked as part of a shell script.
