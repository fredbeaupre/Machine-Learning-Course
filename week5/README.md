# Getting Started
The main script for the assignment is `ex5.m`. The data is in `ex5data1.mat`.
## Overview and Objective
The code implements regularized linear regression and polynomial regression. We use the implementations to study models with different bias-variance properties (overfitting and underfitting).
The dataset consists of historical records on the change in water level, x, and the amount of water flowing out of a dam, y. We use logistic regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of the dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. 
The dataset is divided into:  
- A training set
- A cross validation set
- A test set
