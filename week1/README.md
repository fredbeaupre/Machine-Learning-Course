## Getting Started
The main scripts for this assignments are 'ex1.m' and 'ex1_multi.m', which implement linear regression with one variable 
and linear regression with multiple variables, respectively. The dataset can be found in 'ex1data.txt'. The first column corresponds 
to the population of a city, while the second corresponds to profits from a food truck chain in that city.
## Objective
Using gradient descent, the linear regression parameters are fit to the dataset and used to minimize the cost function. Ultimately,
the goal of the program is to determine which city to expand to next.
## TODO
- Vectorize 'gradientDescent.m' and 'computeCost.m'
- Complete the code for linear regression with multiple variables
