# Getting Started
The main scripts for this assignments are `ex8.m` and `ex8_cofi.m`. They implement the anomaly detection algorithm applied to detecting failing servers on a network, and the collaborative filtering algorithm for a movie recommencer system, respectively.
# Overview
In the second part of the assignment, we implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it on a dataset of movie ratings. The dataset consists of 943 users and 1682 movies. The collaborative filtering algorithm in the setting of movie recommendations considers a set of n-dimensional parameter vectors, where the model predicts the rating for movie i by user j.
