# Getting Started
The main script for this assignment is `ex4.m`; it is generously commented so as to guide you through the other scripts. 
The data can be found in `ex4data1.mat`.
# Overview and Objectives
Following from the assignment of week 3, in this exercise we implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and use it once more for hand-written digit recognition. 
While in week 3 we only implemented feedforward propagation with weights already provided, we now use the backpropagation algorithm to **learn** the parameters for the neural network.
The neural network consists
